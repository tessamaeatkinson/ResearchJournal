leftDoubleImage,Aristocrat,Gambaling machine manufacturer,"Aristocrat Leisure Limited is an Australian gambling machine manufacturer, which has its administrative and research headquarters in the Sydney suburb of North Ryde. Aside from spinning reel slot machines, the company has interests in gambling systems (computerized network systems that manage slot machines), computerized card game simulations, electronic table games, and linked jackpot systems (such as the patented Hyperlink systems). The company has developed the Reel Power system, where players buy reels instead of lines, winning combinations in the standard configuration.
I'm intrigued by the company's ideals and website, particularly considering its significant profits from the gambling industry. Interestingly, the company strives to emulate video game aesthetics to attract users. Video game ideology is apparent throughout the organization, including its engaging and interactive website, designed to evoke pleasure and excitement while sidestepping the potentially unethical motives underlying its operations.",https://www.8newsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2021/09/Aristocrat-Gaming-Website.jpg?strip=1,https://assets-global.website-files.com/6408a1a780c7da2f8396b3e8/64bed184bddc16af145c97ec_Aristocrat_SlotMachines_Additional1-1858x1044.jpg,Aristocrat Website ,Aristocrat Manufacturing slot machines ,https://ropac.net/artists/231-vera-molnar/,"Gambling, Gaming, Webdesign",

She is based in Berlin and Munich, and her artistic practice spans across kinetic art, drawing, video, installation, painting, performance, and sculpture. Her works have been showcased in exhibitions across Europe, Asia, North America, and South America. ""ADA"" is an interactive artwork by Smigla-Bobinski imbued with a soul, acting autonomously. Unlike Tinguely's machines that wryly self-destruct, ""ADA"" is a post-industrial creation, resembling a molecular hybrid, engaging visitors in its creative process. Filled with helium and equipped with charcoals, the transparent globe of ""ADA"" floats freely, leaving marks on surfaces as it moves, defying control from visitors. Stemming from the tradition of Ada Lovelace's vision for computers to create art, ""ADA"" embodies a fusion of mathematics and artistic expression, echoing historical precedents like the Memex Machine and Jacquards loom. As an embodiment of modern biotechnology, ""ADA"" evolves in complexity with audience interaction, leaving enigmatic traces reminiscent of dreamlike associations, challenging decipherment even by the artist herself. I am particularly drawn to her explorations which interact with a space and people can visually change a space. The idea that people a control and effect a space has major implications on how I can incorporate space and interaction through the vessel of tech. Although her work often has a more artistic application, its concept is the main aspect I want translate into my own investigations of how people interact and control with a space with adaptable tech to illustrate these changes.",https://www.irenebrination.com/.a/6a00e55290e7c488330282e14a4ac4200b-800wi,https://smigla-bobinski.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ADA-64.jpg,ADA before human interactions ,ADA in exhibition,https://smigla-bobinski.com/ada/,Artist,

left,Ned Kahn,Artist and Developer,"Ned Kahn is recognised as an environmental artist and sculptor, renowned for his contributions to museum exhibits, including notable installations such as the Exploratorium in San Francisco. His artistic endeavours typically aim to render imperceptible elements of nature visible to viewers. One of his works, Firefly dramatically reveals how wind moves around and through it. The hinged, polycarbonate panels swing with the unseen patterns of the wind. Each panel has a small imbedded magnet that connects with an electrical reed switch. By day, the work appears like rippling waves of glass. By night, the back and forth swinging of the panels trigger the flickering of tiny led lights. The illumination of this entire sculpture requires less energy than a 75-watt light bulb. The artwork also serves as a gantry for a series of power-generating, vertical axis wind turbines that power the lights as well as feeding electricity back into the building. The idea of using natural elements like light or wind to interact with tech is the main aspect of Kahns designs I am interested in. As people we interact with the elements constantly but having the addition of tech which aims to improve our living conditions, without having a negative effect on the environment is something we should be considering when creating and designing. I aim to explore the how the interaction between us and natural elements can we observed by tech and translated to improve our way of living.",https://live.staticflickr.com/7131/7410059538_28e183c8ff_b.jpg,,"Firefly,Public UtilitiesCommision (PUC), San Francisco, CA 2012",,https://nedkahn.com/portfolio/firefly,"Design, Artist, Architecture ",

left,Rudolph de Harak,Designer,"Rudolph de Harak, born in Culver City, California in 1924, drew inspiration from the luminaries of modernism in both art and architecture. Despite his methodical approach, de Harak infused his designs with vibrancy, humour, and affection. He once said: I tried to evolve forms that in feeling covered the entire emotional spectrum, and also were impeccable in their sense of order. This to me was modernism, and toward that end, I wanted to create constellations so rich that they in themselves would communicate content. Steven Heller describes his work as a solid link between American and Swiss modernism... an exemplar of minimalist form with a conceptual content. Over his five-decade career, de Harak applied this sensibility to a diverse array of projects, spanning from record sleeves and magazine covers to exhibitions and building facades, encompassing furniture, corporate identities, and pictograms. His contributions include iconic paper shopping bags for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and book covers for publishers McGraw-Hill, which rival the visual impact of Penguin covers from the same era. His style inspires my own physical work, incorporating humor and sensibility to create modern ingenuities and designs. His evocative creations hint at a more personal and adaptable approach, which I aim to translate into my explorations of interactivity and the role of media in conveying conceptual ideas and perspectives.",https://nostos.jp/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nsts-13214-2.jpg,,Rudolph de Harak Journal covers,, John's Design Library,"Graphicdesign, Artist",
